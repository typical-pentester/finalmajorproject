# AI-Powered Document Question-Answering System

A production-ready Document-Based Question-Answering (QA) system that combines PDF ingestion, FAISS vector search, and Large Language Models to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. This system enables users to upload PDF documents and receive intelligent answers to natural language questions based on the document content.

## 🚀 Key Features

**Document Processing & Intelligence**
- Automated PDF text extraction and intelligent chunking with configurable overlap
- Semantic embedding generation using state-of-the-art sentence transformers
- High-performance vector search through FAISS indexing
- Context-aware answer generation powered by Large Language Models

**User Experience & Security**
- Secure user authentication and session management
- Intuitive web interface for document upload and querying
- Real-time question answering with contextual responses
- Built-in grammar checking and NLP processing capabilities

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The system implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture with the following pipeline:

**Document Ingestion Phase:**
1. PDF upload and text extraction using PyPDFLoader
2. Intelligent text chunking (2000 characters with 200-character overlap)
3. Semantic embedding generation via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model
4. Vector storage in FAISS index for efficient retrieval

**Query Processing Phase:**
1. User question processing and embedding
2. Semantic similarity search through FAISS vector database
3. Context retrieval and ranking of relevant document chunks
4. Answer generation using ChatGroq LLM with retrieved context

This architecture ensures both accuracy and performance, making it suitable for production deployment.

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/typical-pentester/finalmajorproject.git
   cd finalmajorproject
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install faiss-cpu  # For CPU-based FAISS
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

5. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## 💡 Usage Examples

**Document Upload:**
Navigate to the upload interface, select PDF files, and wait for processing completion. The system will automatically extract text, create embeddings, and build the searchable index.

**Question Answering:**
Enter natural language questions about your uploaded documents. The system will retrieve relevant context and provide accurate, source-based answers.

**Example Query:**
```
Question: "What are the main conclusions of the research paper?"
System Response: Based on the uploaded document, the main conclusions include... [contextual answer with relevant excerpts]
```
